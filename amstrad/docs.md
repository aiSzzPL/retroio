Access to the file system itself references the AMSDOS and CP/M specifications, and other tools.


## Amstrad DSK Geometry

Geometry for DSK files follows the specification at http://cpctech.cpc-live.com/docs/dsk.html

* Track 0 (or Track 0 side 0 for double sided disks), if track data exists,
  will immediately follow the Disc Information Block and will start at
  offset &100 in the disc image file.
* All tracks must have a "Track Information Block"
* Track lengths are stored in the same order as the tracks in the image. In
  the case of a double sided disk:
    Track 0 side 0, Track 0 side 1, Track 1 side 0, etc.
* The track blocks are stored in increasing order 0..number of tracks, with
  alternating sides interleaved if the disc image describes a double sided
  disk.
  E.g. if the disk image represents a double sided disk, the track order is:
  - track 0 side 0,
  - track 0 side 1,
  - track 1 side 0,
  - track 1 side 1....
  - track (number of tracks-1) side 0, track (number of tracks-1) side 1

The tracks are always ordered in this way regardless of the disc-format
described by the disc image.

A standard disk image can be used to describe a copy-protected disk, but will
often result in a file which is larger than the same disk described by a
extended disk image.

For a standard disk image to represent a copy-protected disk:
  - All track sizes in the standard disk image must be the same. This value
    therefore would be the size of the largest track, and other tracks would
    have unused space in them.
  - All sector sizes within each track must be the same size, but not
    necessarily the same size as the sectors for another track. If a track
    contained different sized sectors, the size of the largest sector should
    be used. This would result in some wasted space.


### Disc media type (sidedness)

     Bit |  Description
    -----|------------------------------------------------
     0-1 | 0 => Single sided
         | 1 => Double sided, flip sides
         |    ie track   0 is cylinder   0 head 0
         |       track   1 is cylinder   0 head 1
         |       track   2 is cylinder   1 head 0
         |       ...
         |       track n-1 is cylinder n/2 head 0
         |       track   n is cylinder n/2 head 1
         | 2 => Double sided, up and over
         |    ie track   0 is cylinder 0 head 0
         |       track   1 is cylinder 1 head 0
         |       track   2 is cylinder 2 head 0
         |       ...
         |       track n-2 is cylinder 2 head 1
         |       track n-1 is cylinder 1 head 1
         |       track   n is cylinder 0 head 1
      6  | Set if the format is for a high-density disc
         |   This is an extension in PCW16 CP/M, BIOS 0.09+.
         |   It is not an official part of the spec.
      7  | Set if the format is double track.

## Amstrad Disc Formats

Amstrad computers use standard CP/M 2 or CP/M 3 formats. The disc formats used
also include automatic format detection systems.

AMSDOS and the CP/M 2.2 BIOS support three different disc formats: `SYSTEM`,
`DATA ONLY`, and `IBM` formats.b

The CP/M Plus BIOS supports only the `SYSTEM` and `DATA` formats.

The BIOS automatically detects the format of a disc. Under CP/M this occurs
for drive `A` at a warm boot, and for drive `B` the first time it is accessed.
Under AMSDOS this occurs each time a disc with no open files is accessed. To
permit this automatic detection each format has unique sector numbers as
detailed below.

3-inch discs are double sided, but only one side may be accessed at a time
depending on which way round the user inserts the disc. There my be different
formats on the two sides.

### Common To All Formats

* Single sided (the two sides of a 3 inch disc are treated separately).
* 512 byte physical sector size.
* 40 track numbered 0 to 39.
* 1024 byte CP/M block size.
* 64 directory entries.

### SYSTEM Format

* 9 sectors per track numbered #41 to #49.
* 2 reserved tracks.
* 2 reserved tracks.
* 2 to 1 sector interleave.

The system format is the main format supported, CP/M can only be loaded (Cold Boot)
from a system format disc. CP/M 2.2 also requires a system format disc to warm boot.

The reserved tracks are used as follows:
* Track 0 sector   #41:       boot sector.
* Track 0 sectors  #42:       configuration sector
* Track 0 sectors  #43..#47:  unused
* Track 0 sectors  #41..#49:  and
* Track 1 sectors  #48..#49:  CCP and BIOS

* CP/M Plus only uses Track 0 sector #41 as a boot sector
* Track 0 sector #42...#49 and Track 1 are unused.

NOTE: another format called 'VENDOR' format is a special version of system
format which does not contain any software on the two reserved tracks. It
is intended for use in software distribution.

### DATA ONLY Format

* 9 sectors per track numbered #C1 to #C9.
* 0 reserved tracks.
* 2 to 1 sector interleave.

This format is not recommended for use with CP/M 2.2 since it is not possible
to ‘warm boot’ from it. However, because there is a little more disc space
available it is useful for AMSDOS or CP/M Plus.

### IBM Format

* 8 sectors per track numbered 1 to 8
* 1 reserved track
* no sector interleave

This format is logically the same as the single-sided format used by CP/M on
the IBM PC. It is intended for specialist use and is not otherwise recommended
as it is not possible to 'warm boot' from it.

## AMSDOS and non-CP/M disc formats

Amstrad and Locomotive Software have made a number of non-CP/M systems which
are based on the CP/M 2 disc format. These are:

* LocoScript - word processor with built-in operating system.
* AMSDOS     - disc operating system for the CPC computers.
* +3DOS      - disc operating system for the Spectrum +3.

Some common Amstrad Extended Disk Parameter Block headers for the different
disk formats (all numbers are in Hex):

### Boot Sector

In order that non-CP/M systems may be implemented at a later date the BIOS
initialization is performed, in part, by a boot program which is read from the
disc before attempting to load CP/M. In the non-CP/M case the boot program
would not jump to the warm boot routine but go on its own way, using the BIOS
and firmware routines as desired.

The boot program is in the boot sector which is the first sector (sector #41)
on track 0.
